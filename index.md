# Project 3 - Immersive Narrative

## The Road To Acceptance - Amina, Ons, Thaís

### Introduction

Grief is an inevitable part of the human experience. Although the feeling of grief is universal, the way each individual copes with it is not. While one can go through all of the five — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance — stages of it, most often it is difficult to move on without seeking support or professional help.

With our Unity Virtual Reality Project, we aim to create a gaming experience — The Road to Acceptance — that will immerse the user into a storyline involving grief and completing its five stages. We hope that with recent developments in the XR metaverse, experiences that can help people support their mental health will become more widespread.

### Immersive Narrative

he story begins with an audio and visual experience, narrating a series of events that happened before the user entered the game. After a few seconds, the user gets to know that they have lost their loved one, and, as a result, destroyed the whole world in the anger of their grief. As soon as the audio ends, the user is sent to the lobby where they are greeted with a scenery of their village — the lobby — and hear additional instructions on the experience.

Interactions in the lobby are built on the stages of grief. The protagonist has to revisit the stages and “restore” the world by unbuilding the weapon they made — by placing the powerful jewels back to where they belong.

After going through denial, anger, bargaining, and depression, the user reveals an alternate ending of the death of their loved one — the road to acceptance. In the final interaction of the experience, the user gets to speak to their wife one last time and return the last jewel.

If all of the stages are passed successfully, the experience ends with a restored village that symbolizes the healthy coping with grief.

### Visual and User Experience

### Explanation of the World Building

- The UI and Cutscene:

When starting the gaming experience, a UI selection menu appears, after which the user is prompted to watch a short animation explaining the background of the story.

- The Village and the Lobby:

1. Denial Scene:

In this scene, the user discovers that the original gem has disappeared from their hands. Instead, the place is filled with multiple pedestals with a similar jewel — but which one of them is correct? In their journey of figuring out the right one, the user goes through the denial stage — just like most of the jewels are getting denied on the plinth.

2. Anger Scene:

What is a better way to release anger than smashing? Smashing thrice and seeing the glass shatter into pieces! For this scene, we specifically hid the returning plinth under three layers of glass and placed a bat nearby. The user is greeted with audio instructions and is expected to release the anger to move past this stage of grief.

3. Bargaining Scene:

In the introductory audio, the user is greeted by a non-playable character that reveals the instructions on how to return the gem. Grilotta, the NPC, is placed there to bargain with the player — and help them move on past this stage.

5. Depression Scene:

As soon as the user enters this experience, they notice a dark scenery and their gem loses its original color. Meant to simulate the real depression experience, the scene pushes the user to look for what is beyond there and restore the original color to the gem.

6. Acceptance Scene and Restored World:

After completing all of the previous four stages of grief, one last scene appears in which the protagonist faces the grave of their loved one in a chance to fix the world. A new, last scene appears with the restored world if all of the interactions are complete.

### Reflections — Journey and Challenges

We began working on this project on November 3rd and finished it on December 13th. Given the variety of scenes and related actions, our main strategy was to first focus on interactions and then on worldbuilding around it.

Overall timeline:

- Weeks 1-4 building the interactions MVP,
- Weeks 5-7 worldbuilding and aesthetics.
- 
Some of the challenges faced along the way were fixing the technical details behind the Denial Scene code, scene unloading / transition manager, and storytelling details. More details on our weekly challenges can be found in Dev Journal on Brightspace. Big thanks to Professor Michael Allison for helping us debug and polish the project.
